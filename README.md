# Machine-Learning- This project encompasses applying machine-learning techniques to predict the quality of red wine based on its intrinsic chemical attributes. 
Beginning with data import and preprocessing, the dataset's 1599 instances and 12 features are scrutinized. 
A comprehensive data analysis reveals correlations through visualizations like heat maps.
The project employs a Random Forest Classifier model, trained on a split dataset, to predict wine quality.
Model evaluation via accuracy measurement showcases its proficiency in predicting wine quality accurately.
Ultimately, the project culminates in creating a predictive system that gauges wine quality based on inputted chemical attributes. 
This amalgamation of data analysis, machine learning, and predictive modeling offers insights into enhancing the evaluation of red wine quality through a systematic and data-driven approach.
